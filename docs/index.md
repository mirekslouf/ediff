EDIFF :: Documentation and examples
-----------------------------------

Quick start = [Jupyter notebook](./examples/ex1_ediff.nb.html)
which shows complete data processing:

* Conversion of 2D-diffractogram to radially averaged diffraction 1D-profile
* Semi-automatic interactive background subtraction in 1D-profile
* Calculation of theoretical PXRD pattern
* Calibration of ED profile by means of PXRD pattern
* Final result = comparison of the experimental ED-profile with calculated PXRD
