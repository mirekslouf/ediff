<h2>EDIFF :: processing of powder electron diffraction patterns</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>EDIFF</em> is a Python package that...<ul>
<li>processes powder electron diffraction patterns</li>
<li>contains templates that can be used even by non-crystallographers</li>
<li>focuses on simple usage, but contains also several advanced features</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>EDIFF</em> can...<ol>
<li>read image with 2D powder electron diffraction pattern</li>
<li>determine the center of 2D powder diffration pattern</li>
<li>convert 2D pattern to 1D diffraction profile (radial averaging)</li>
<li>remove background from 1D diffractogram (with a little help of the user)</li>
<li>calibrate 1D diffractogram (X-axis: pixels &rarr; diffraction vector q)</li>
<li>calculate theoretical powder X-ray diffraction pattern</li>
<li>compare experimental and theoretical diffraction patterns</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
