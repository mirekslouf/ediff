EDIFF :: processing of powder electron diffraction patterns
-----------------------------------------------------------

* *EDIFF* is a Python package that...
	- processes powder electron diffraction patterns
	- contains templates that can be used even by non-crystallographers
	- focuses on simple usage, but contains also several advanced features
* *EDIFF* can...
	1. read image with 2D powder electron diffraction pattern
	2. determine the center of 2D powder diffration pattern
	3. convert 2D pattern to 1D diffraction profile (radial averaging)
	4. remove background from 1D diffractogram (with a little help of the user)
	5. calibrate 1D diffractogram (X-axis: pixels &rarr; diffraction vector q)
	6. calculate theoretical powder X-ray diffraction pattern
	7. compare experimental and theoretical diffraction patterns
